# NoitaWandsInMinecraft

---

**I hereby give up my ownership of the mod name/id *NoitaCraft* and make it into to *NoitaWandsInMinecraft*, hence anyone else who wants to make a better Noita-themed mod can take that mod name/id.**

No, I won't working on this project. I already proved I can make Noita's casting system in Minecraft, and that's enough.
